Wyatt Kribs ENIGMA project self eval:

functionality: 3.0
Everything is functional as to the spec, and you have the ability to not only
scramble text but also to take other people's text and translate it as long as
you have the date and the key.

Object oriented programming 2.0
SRP is unfortunately not followed. the enigma class should be split into two
parts, one that handles the encryption and one that handles the decryption.

Ruby conventions 2.75
Text is clean and readable, there are a few instances where it could be tighter
but overall it does it's job.

TDD 2.5
Tests mostly cover what the methods implemented do, some edge cases have possibly
been left out and integration level tests could use some improvement.

Version Control 1.5
Still a lot to work on, a few pull requests but commits are few and far between.
Something to work on for sure.
